## Introduction 


To demonstrate the skills I learned from multiverse bootcamp, I designed and implemented this application as a learning exercise(Hackathon project). This project aims to assist recruiters in making knowledgeable decisions both during and before the hiring process. Currently, application tracking systems (ATS) is used by the majority of recruiters to screen out candidates that standout of from the crowd. However, because the ATS screening process is based on the percentage of keywords in an applicant's resume that match the job criteria, it is possible to pass it if you understand how the system operates. In contrast to the ATS's goal, hiring managers and recruiters should therefore go above and beyond to analyze the applications of candidates who haven't even satisfied the minimum requirements but passed the initial screening. This results in a loss for both engineers and recruiters as they expend time and effort on fruitless communication. Not only during the hiring process, but also  when recruiters want to invite candidates to apply for a specific role, since their search on LinkedIn or other professional networking sites still relies on keyword matching, there is no way to know for sure if that candidate is the right fit for the position. On the other hand, recruiters also inundate developers with invitation emails for roles for which they are ineligible or lack the necessary skills. That is also the main reason why I am motivated to develop this application. Apparently, ontop of ATS, there is a need to develop a decision support system for recruiters. This application is also made to assist recruiters in seeing more about the technical and behavioral component of the developers before contacting them. This will save both parties' time and energy in back and forth communication. 
As a source of information, i used github,linkedin and twitter api data. Thus, by blending the data from these three sources, the application also performs a fact-check comparison and provides insights about developer. But until I get access to the full linkedin and twitter profiles of developers, both site's dashboard remains disabled and shown using mock data.
